\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
In 1990 the first website was published to the Internet and became available to people worldwide who already had access to the Internet at these times. This amount of people was very limited in the early years and websites were just simple HTML files with static content maybe containing even some pictures and links. Over the years the Web has evolved dramatically and today it's nearly inevitable for successful businesses around the world to survive without it. Companies present themselves with websites, sell their products and provide services for their customers online. 

A good web experience nowadays is crucial and the speed of a website often plays a key role whether an interested visitor becomes a customer or not. Therefore it's a factor a successful company should not neglect when developing and maintaining a website. This thesis documents the detailed investigation of the performance of a business website and outlines possibilities to improve the perceived web experience based on the Upper Austrian pet tracking company Tractive GmbH.  

\section{Motivation}

Throughout all the innovative developments in telecommunication the web browser has become the most widespread deployment platform to developers. Industry growth projections predict an amount of 20 billion connected devices by 2020 and each device comes with a browser installed. In contrast to all different applications which are somehow tailored to fulfil some defined tasks for a given targeted audience, the browser does not have any limitations disregarded of the type of the device, used platform, manufacturer etc. Due to this importance the browser from the early days looks nearly nothing like the one we use nowadays on our devices. Concurrently with these technical innovations the variety and complexity of tasks which can be done via the Web has increased as well and the user expectations on web applications are very high. This is why web performance definitely has to be considered a feature next to design for instance. Empirical studies showed that users tend to drop away from slow websites whereas faster websites lead to
	\begin{itemize}
		\item better user engagement
		\item better user retention
		\item higher conversion rates (indicates how many of the website visitors convert the paying customers)
	\end{itemize}
Single page applications, responsive designs, cool CSS3 animations or a bunch of new Web UI components featured by HTML5 are only a few things which come along with modern web applications as they appear in our todays web browsers. All these innovations add complexity and therefore more data to be handled throughout the network. This introduces a further challenge for web engineers as all this design tweaks require more work to deliver high performance web applications to their users.    
Understanding how the web with it's different underlying protocols works is essential. Good developers have to have some deeper knowledge of how the bits within a HTTP request are transported from one point to another as well as how the browser on the client side renders HTML, loads media and processes JavaScript. ~\cite{Grigorik_2013}

\section{What is Tractive?}

Tractive GmbH produces hardware devices for pets as well as develops software applications which allow users to communicate with their pets wearing these devices. The company was founded in Pasching, Upper Austria in 2012 and offers today several different devices whereby the origin goal was to find and locate pets fitted with a GPS tracker using a Smartphone App. In addition to the hardware devices and mobile apps Tractive develops and maintains a Website providing all the necessary product information for potential customers as well as a web shop which allows customers to purchase products and a web application where registered users can manage their trackers and pets. 

This thesis will focus on the company's main Website containing all de-facto static content as well as the mentioned Pet Manager. During this thesis these parts are re-designed as well as integrated and connected to the current backend containing the data and business services used by client applications. Next to a good "look and feel" it was important for the company to evaluate how well the current website performs and try to find bottlenecks which should be considered and fixed when integrating the new Website.     

\section{Objective and Outline of the Thesis}

This thesis will contribute towards a deeper understanding of performance influencing factors of modern web sites.
It will therefore start with an overview of web performance metrics typically used in performance evaluation studies (see section~\ref{chap:metrics}.
To relate those metrics to the actual performance behaviour of a real world web site, the tractive case study will be used. 
In section \ref{chap:architecture} the architecture of the system under test will be briefly described.
The next section~\ref{chap:measurements} will discuss the  experimental design of the measurements as well as the results.
Based on this, suggested improvements~\ref{chap:improvements}  and an outlook on future work~\ref{chap:conclusions} will conclude the thesis.
